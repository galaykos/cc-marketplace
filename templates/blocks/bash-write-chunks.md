# --- bash write chunks --------------------------------------------------------
# Canonical copy: templates/blocks/bash-write-chunks.md. Every hook defining
# cc_bash_write_chunks must carry this block byte-for-byte (pc_shared_blocks).
# cc_bash_write_chunks <command> — what a Bash command puts INTO files: the text a content
# guard reads on Bash where its Write path reads tool_input.content. Prints chunks: a line that
# starts with \036 and carries the WRITER — the pipeline (split on ; && ||, never inside
# quotes) whose targets the caller resolves with cc_bash_write_targets — then the
# chunk's text lines. Two sources, and only two:
#   - a heredoc BODY: the lines between `<<TERM` (`<<-`, quoted or `\`-escaped TERM too)
#     and TERM; writer = the pipeline holding the `<<` (`cat > f <<EOF`,
#     `cat <<EOF | tee -a f`);
#   - the ARGUMENTS of an `echo`/`printf` segment, as written: the rest of the segment after
#     the command word, quotes, escapes and any `> file` redirect kept (so match inside the
#     text, never anchored at its start); writer = its pipeline
#     (`echo "K=v" >> .env.example`, `printf '%s\n' v | tee f`).
# A chunk whose writer names no file is dropped by the caller, so `git commit -F - <<EOF`
# and `echo x | grep y` yield nothing. The body of ANY heredoc whose pipeline writes a file
# is read, whatever consumes it — `python3 - <<PY > out.txt` included, where the script is
# not what lands in out.txt. Accepted: the text sits in a file-writing command either
# way.
# NOT read, stated: a `{ echo …; } > f` group (the redirect sits on the closer, not on
# the echo's pipeline); a here-string `<<<`; printf's format substitution (`printf
# 'K=%s' v` is read as written: the format and the argument, never the substituted
# line); a quoted string or a `\` continuation spanning lines; a second heredoc opened
# on one line.
# mask() copies the one inside cc_bash_write_targets: the block is byte-locked and its
# awk functions are not reachable from outside it.

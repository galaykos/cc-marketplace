1. Determine scope from $ARGUMENTS — a file, directory, diff/branch reference, or
   design document. If empty, default to recent changes (`git diff` against the merge
   base, falling back to the latest commits).

2. Run a triage pass before the deep read. A trivial, single-file, or purely mechanical
   change earns a one-line verdict — state it and stop. Treat the change as risky and
   take the deep pass when it touches auth, data, migrations, or concurrency, OR spans
   more than 5 files, OR exceeds 300 changed lines (a NEW file counts its full length as
   changed).

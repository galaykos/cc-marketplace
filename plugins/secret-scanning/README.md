# secret-scanning

Blocks secrets before they reach disk.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add galaykos/cc-marketplace
/plugin install secret-scanning@cc-plugins-marketplace
```

## What's included

- **PreToolUse hook** (`hooks/scan.sh`) — denies any `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit` whose
  incoming text carries a high-confidence secret (cloud keys, private-key blocks,
  provider tokens, assigned secret literals). Fail-open: any error or a missing `jq`
  allows the write, so the guard never wedges a session.
- **`/secret-scanning:scan`** — sweeps a path, diff, or the whole repo for secrets
  already in the tree (what the write-time hook never saw).
- **`secret-scanning` skill** — the patterns, why a hook beats advice, remediation
  (rotate, don't just delete), and honest limits.

High-confidence by design: it under-flags rather than over-blocks, so pair it with a
full scanner (gitleaks, trufflehog) in CI. Obvious placeholders and fixtures pass; a
denial always offers the fixture escape.

Since 0.3.0 the deny path has its own fixture harness (`scripts/__tests__/`,
CI-globbed) — every pattern proven to deny, fail-open proven to stay open. Writing it
found and fixed a real regression: the private-key pattern begins with dashes, and
without `grep -- ` it had been parsed as options and NEVER matched. That deny is live
for the first time; the harness exists so a silent regression like it cannot ship
green again.
